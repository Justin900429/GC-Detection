## Introduction 
Although there are lots of **object detection applications**, most of the applications are **hard to deploy**. In our project, we aim at **creating an simple application** that user can easily do the object detection jobs. In one of our demonstration, we will **simulate a seismic disaster and use a drone to do the search and rescue with our application**. This demonstration can show the value of our project.

## Demonstration

- **Red region**
    Show the image which the camera captured and draw the bounding boxes of the certain objects
- **Orange region**
    Press this button to capture the right now image and save this image to certain root(Google Cloud or local)
- **Green region**
    Show which categories display in the red region
- **Blue region**
    Press this button to leave the GUI 


## Main Goals
- Quickly deploy the object detection application

## Installation
Before install the package, we highly recommend to build the virtual env. There are lots of tools user can choose. Below, we demonstrate how to use in conda environment.

```
conda create -n name-of-env python=3.8
conda activate name-of-env
```

- PyPI
```
pip install GCDetection
```

- Build from source
```
git clone https://github.com/Justin900429/GC-Detection.git
cd GC-Detection
pip install -e .
```
