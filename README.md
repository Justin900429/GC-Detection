## Introduction 
Although there are lots of **object detection applications**, most of the applications are **hard to deploy**. In our project, we aim at **creating a simple application** that users can easily do the object detection jobs. In one of our demonstration, we used **drone to find out where the balls were and saved the images on Google Cloud**. This demonstration is a simple version of doing search and rescue. Namely, ball can be replaced with real people. This demonstration shows the value of our project.

## Objectives
There are three main objectives of our project.
1. Make object detection easier.
2. Used in the field of search and rescue.
3. Do the crowd counting.

## Interface layout

- **Orange region**
    Press this button to capture the image and save image to certain root(Google Cloud or local)
- **Green region**
    Show which categories display in the red region
- **Blue region**
    Press this button to leave the GUI
